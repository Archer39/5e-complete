Tempest gods send their clerics to inspire fear in the common folk, either to keep those folk on the path of righteousness or to encourage them to offer sacrifices of propitiation to ward off divine wrath.</p>\n<h3>Tempest Domain Spells</h3>\n<table>\n<thead style=\"text-shadow:1px 1px var(--color-shadow-dark);border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-border-dark)\">\n<tr>\n<td>Cleric Level</td>\n<td>Spells</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.zjff2IdTPpUwWCUj]{Fog Cloud}, @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.SHmTDvXfGItXBTs6]{Thunderwave}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.NJoboox7UplFADzn]{Gust of Wind}, @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.6GqRMNBXcKg4Z6x7]{Shatter}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.bsmm4jV1tMjyU00g]{Call Lightning}, @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.sNfU0BaHmjqml2zk]{Sleet Storm}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.uLXgUtgVTI6Qiyyn]{Control Water}, @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.rdiygKbI2F4JWVgd]{Ice Storm}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.2QHWawdXbC6WLHNx]{Destructive Wave}, @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.ppzHP9AZKXu2IWyz]{Insect Plague}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Tempest Domain Features</h3>\n<p>1st Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.OOjymxRt3nYW4Vkq]{Bonus Proficiencies}, @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.OIKVjdXT1T8PZAMm]{Wrath of the Storm}</p>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.46WyZOUsnGrZ2cJ3]{Channel Divinity: Destructive Wrath}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.8cIdV2EU7BC8MW1m]{Thunderous Strike}</p>\n<p>8th Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.BTAbeZUzhYhCeRbw]{Divine Strike}</p>\n<p>17th Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.tvfx0Yvn2tvjC7sW]{Stormborn}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","identifier":"tempest-domain","classIdentifier":"cleric","advancement":[{"_id":"g9vgerz1e7qvqnv0","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.OOjymxRt3nYW4Vkq","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.OIKVjdXT1T8PZAMm","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.zjff2IdTPpUwWCUj","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.SHmTDvXfGItXBTs6"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"always","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":1,"title":"Tempest Domain Features and Spells","icon":""},{"_id":"ba5qnh409p6i04ad","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.46WyZOUsnGrZ2cJ3"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":2,"title":"Tempest Domain Feature","icon":""},{"_id":"9vucgofhekhhgpz5","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.8cIdV2EU7BC8MW1m"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":6,"title":"Tempest Domain Feature","icon":""},{"_id":"7ek7uokhpzwcmnv0","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.BTAbeZUzhYhCeRbw"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":8,"title":"Tempest Domain Feature","icon":""},{"_id":"86t97cpvcu7t5g85","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.tvfx0Yvn2tvjC7sW"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":17,"title":"Tempest Domain Feature","icon":""},{"_id":"lliw0jgc8fc2ibth","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.NJoboox7UplFADzn","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.6GqRMNBXcKg4Z6x7"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"always","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":3,"title":"Tempest Domain Spells","icon":""},{"_id":"hu5snoabtf4rd3jr","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.bsmm4jV1tMjyU00g","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.sNfU0BaHmjqml2zk"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"always","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":5,"title":"Tempest Domain Spells","icon":""},{"_id":"z9vhca5j2ktx03p4","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.uLXgUtgVTI6Qiyyn","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.rdiygKbI2F4JWVgd"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"always","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":7,"title":"Tempest Domain Spells","icon":""},{"_id":"1oajczpfjkpl33o9","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.2QHWawdXbC6WLHNx","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.ppzHP9AZKXu2IWyz"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"always","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":9,"title":"Tempest Domain Spells","icon":""}],"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"ownership":{"default":0,"EHpONhziSoZpUpN3":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664691271233,"lastModifiedBy":"UjfixXuqstXNdypa"}}

Other war gods (such as Tempus, Nike, and Nuada) take a more neutral stance, promoting war in all its manifestations and supporting warriors in any circumstance.</p>\n<h3>War Domain Spells</h3>\n<table>\n<thead style=\"text-shadow:1px 1px var(--color-shadow-dark);border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-border-dark)\">\n<tr>\n<td>Cleric Level</td>\n<td>Spells</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.LymySqyRtKl18fDM]{Divine Favor}, @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.d6qqgYraYA9iTehx]{Shield of Faith}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.6Wy3kcKkuUadyapw]{Magic Weapon}, @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.hpIDXvgdhqbiXmHT]{Spiritual Weapon}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.miB9W71EY9nMPv5C]{Crusader's Mantle}, @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.IkmJtuNGui71amCl]{Spirit Guardians}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.bYFfYKrx0SOSCBYw]{Freedom of Movement}, @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.BmWgCc1hVRkNlQHf]{Stoneskin}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.T1B0j8lU67x3SccN]{Flame Strike}, @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.R6HwuSHAkPV4kAzF]{Hold Monster}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>War Domain Features</h3>\n<p>1st Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.02LnB91YxrAlxRzx]{Bonus Proficiency}, @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.LtyMzKOCCUn01ZZD]{War Priest}</p>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.y43Mzq2ij12cG2y8]{Channel Divinity: Guided Strike}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.9ZZlIjz9kyRLQa1U]{Channel Divinity: War God's Blessing}</p>\n<p>8th Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.cWPsDMrlpG9pu2Gs]{Divine Strike}</p>\n<p>17th Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.Xu6rPqfRYzjT6jwT]{Avatar of Battle}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","identifier":"war-domain","classIdentifier":"cleric","advancement":[{"_id":"48tqo3fb15ugjqyf","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.02LnB91YxrAlxRzx","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.LtyMzKOCCUn01ZZD","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.LymySqyRtKl18fDM","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.d6qqgYraYA9iTehx"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"always","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":1,"title":"War Domain Features and Spells","icon":""},{"_id":"swonj0nfruosq06q","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.y43Mzq2ij12cG2y8"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":2,"title":"War Domain Feature","icon":""},{"_id":"rzqqsuv7otae63sb","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.9ZZlIjz9kyRLQa1U"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":6,"title":"War Domain Feature","icon":""},{"_id":"d7rm094dm95f016v","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.cWPsDMrlpG9pu2Gs"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":8,"title":"War Domain Feature","icon":""},{"_id":"hehp7xsei7tobljr","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.Xu6rPqfRYzjT6jwT"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":17,"title":"War Domain Feature","icon":""},{"_id":"4ycnes7yv8a7arxn","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.6Wy3kcKkuUadyapw","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.hpIDXvgdhqbiXmHT"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"always","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":3,"title":"War Domain Spells","icon":""},{"_id":"0sw6ngwo02mq1g02","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.miB9W71EY9nMPv5C","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.IkmJtuNGui71amCl"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"always","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":5,"title":"War Domain Spells","icon":""},{"_id":"s9i5gxjd26h7mwr8","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.bYFfYKrx0SOSCBYw","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.BmWgCc1hVRkNlQHf"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"always","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":7,"title":"War Domain Spells","icon":""},{"_id":"baskyirddpo8oh2t","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.T1B0j8lU67x3SccN","Compendium.5e-complete.5e-spells.R6HwuSHAkPV4kAzF"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"always","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":9,"title":"War Domain Spells","icon":""}],"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"ownership":{"default":0,"EHpONhziSoZpUpN3":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664691442752,"lastModifiedBy":"UjfixXuqstXNdypa"}}
